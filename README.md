# OOP Block Game
This project is a visual block game simulation for COMP 250 (Introduction to Computer Science), McGill University, Winter 2023. It involved implementing a recursive quad-tree data structure to represent hierarchical game boards, applying object-oriented principles such as inheritance and abstraction, and designing algorithms for dynamic board manipulation. The project required implementing recursive methods to flatten tree structures into two-dimensional arrays, computing scoring for two goal types (blob and perimeter), and handling user interactions, including block selection, rotation, reflection, and “smashing” of sub-blocks. This assignment demonstrates skills in recursive problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, careful state management of hierarchical data, and building interactive, rule-based simulations in Java.
